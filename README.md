# ThingsBoard-ThingPark uplinkConverter
This ThingsBoard uplink converter was done as part of my thesis.
It is made to convert and decode data originally coming from Carlo Gavazzi EM24 and UWPA device that goes through Digitas ThingPark first.

The development of the converter is based on a ThingsBoard manual and Carlo Gavazzis UWPA LoRa variables attached to the repository.
